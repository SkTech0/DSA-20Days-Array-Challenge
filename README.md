🚀 Day 1 of 20 – #DSA Arrays Challenge in C#

👨‍💻 Problem: Two Sum
Given an array of integers and a target value, find the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

🔍 Concepts Used:

Hashing with Dictionary

Single-pass array traversal

Optimized for O(n) time complexity

💡 What I Learned:

Importance of using Dictionary<int, int> to track indices

How to avoid brute force O(n²) approach by using complements

Clean and readable code matters for real interviews


## 🧪 Example

```csharp
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]
